# Retail Sales Analysis
## Istanbul, Turkey, 2021-2023

Our goal is to design a system for merchants to analyze sales trends and insights based on factors such as demographics, weather, product categories, payment method,and so forth. Using this system will allow merchants to focus on the factors that are most profitable for them.  

Our system was built using synthetic data with the intention of each merchant plugging in their 'real' data and running the analysis for themselves.
